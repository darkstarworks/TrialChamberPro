## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-24
### Fixed
- Resolved plugin startup failure `NoClassDefFoundError: kotlinx/coroutines/Dispatchers` by stopping relocation of Kotlin stdlib and kotlinx-coroutines during shading. They are still shaded but keep original package names so Bukkit can load them at bootstrap.

### Internal
- Kept relocations for SQLite and HikariCP to avoid classpath conflicts.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-24
### Added

  - Snapshot system for chambers
  - Per-player vaults and loot tables
  - Automatic reset scheduler with warnings
  - Protection listeners and optional integrations (WorldGuard, WorldEdit, PlaceholderAPI)
  - Statistics tracking and leaderboards
