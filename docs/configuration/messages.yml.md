## 🎨 Color Codes & Formatting

All messages support Minecraft color codes using `&`:

### Colors
```yaml
&0 - Black          &8 - Dark Gray
&1 - Dark Blue      &9 - Blue
&2 - Dark Green     &a - Green
&3 - Dark Aqua      &b - Aqua
&4 - Dark Red       &c - Red
&5 - Dark Purple    &d - Light Purple
&6 - Gold           &e - Yellow
&7 - Gray           &f - White
```

### Formatting
```yaml
&l - Bold
&o - Italic
&n - Underline
&m - Strikethrough
&k - Magic/Obfuscated
&r - Reset (removes all formatting)
```

### Examples
```yaml
"&6&lBOLD GOLD TEXT"
"&c&oItalic red text"
"&a✓ &fGreen checkmark, white text"
"&k?????? &r&eMystery text revealed!"
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Pro tip:** Use `&r` to reset formatting before starting new text. Prevents colors bleeding into placeholders!
{% endhint %}

## 🌍 Multi-Language Support

Want to support multiple languages? You can create separate message files!

1. Copy `messages.yml` to `messages_es.yml` (Spanish), `messages_fr.yml` (French), etc.
2. Translate all messages
3. Use a language switcher plugin to change which file is loaded per-player

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** TrialChamberPro doesn't have built-in per-player language switching (yet), but you can manually swap files and reload for server-wide language changes.
{% endhint %}

## 💡 Pro Tips

{% hint style="success" %}
**Test your messages!** Trigger each message in-game to see how it looks in chat. Some look great in the config but ugly in-game.
{% endhint %}

**Don't overdo colors.** Too many colors = eyesore. Stick to 2-3 main colors for consistency.

**Use prefixes wisely.** If you have a very long prefix, consider shortening it or removing it entirely for certain messages (like warnings).

## ❓ Common Questions

**"Can I remove the prefix from all messages?"**
Yes! Set `prefix: ""` (empty string).

**"What if I want different prefixes for different message types?"**
You'll need to manually add prefixes to individual messages instead of using the global prefix.

**"Can I use hex color codes?"**
Not in the current version, but it's planned for a future update!

**"What if I mess up the YAML formatting?"**
The plugin will fail to load messages and log errors. Always backup before editing!

**"Can I add custom messages for my own plugins?"**
TrialChamberPro only uses the messages defined here. For custom messages, you'd need to modify the plugin or request new placeholder support.
