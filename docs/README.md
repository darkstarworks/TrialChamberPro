# 🏛️ TrialChamberPro

> _Transform your Trial Chambers from dusty, one-time dungeons into thriving content that players actually want to revisit!_

Welcome, fellow dungeon master! You've stumbled upon the ultimate solution for Trial Chambers on multiplayer servers. Whether you're running a small vanilla+ server or a massive network, TrialChamberPro breathes new life into Minecraft 1.21's Trial Chambers.

## 🎮 What's the Problem?

Picture this: A player discovers their first Trial Chamber. Heart racing, they battle through waves of mobs, unlock vaults, and claim their rewards. Epic moment, right?

But then... nothing. The chamber sits there, looted and lifeless. Other players arrive to find empty vaults and disappointment. Not exactly the replayable content you want on your server.

**Enter TrialChamberPro.**

## ✨ What Does This Thing Do?

This plugin turns Trial Chambers into **living, breathing content** that keeps players coming back for more:

- 🔄 **Automatic resets** - Chambers restore themselves on a schedule
- 👥 **Per-player loot** - Everyone gets their own vault rewards (no more fighting!)
- 💎 **Custom rewards** - Integrate with your economy, custom items, whatever
- 🛡️ **Protection** - No more griefing your carefully crafted dungeons
- 🎯 **Statistics** - Track completions, deaths, and create leaderboards
- 🌑 **Ominous support** - Full support for both Normal and Ominous variants
- 🔑 **Key management** - Fixes Paper bugs and adds quality-of-life features

## 🚀 Quick Start

Ready to jump in? Here's what you need:

1. **Paper 1.21.x** (or any fork like Purpur, Pufferfish)
2. **Java 21** or newer
3. **Optional:** WorldEdit (for easy chamber creation)

## 🎓 Fun Fact

Did you know Trial Chambers were originally designed as single-player content? The devs didn't account for multiplayer servers where hundreds of players might visit the same chamber. That's why vault loot is "first come, first served" in vanilla.

We fixed that. You're welcome. 😎
