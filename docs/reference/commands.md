## üìö Command Details

### `/tcp help`

Shows a list of all available commands.

**Usage:**
```
/tcp help
```

**Permission:** None (everyone can use this)

**Example:**
```
/tcp help
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Only shows commands you have permission to use!
{% endhint %}

---

### `/tcp add <name>`

Registers an existing Trial Chamber from your WorldEdit selection for management.

### `/tcp generate <value|coords|wand|blocks>`

Registers a chamber using either a saved WorldEdit variable (named region), your current WorldEdit selection, explicit coordinates, or by a desired block amount at your current facing.

Usage:
```
/tcp generate value save <varName>
/tcp generate value list
/tcp generate value delete <varName>
/tcp generate value <varName> [chamberName]
/tcp generate coords <x1,y1,z1> <x2,y2,z2> [world] <chamberName>
/tcp generate wand <chamberName>
/tcp generate blocks <amount> [chamberName] [roundingAllowance]
```

Behavior:
- value save: Saves your current WorldEdit selection to a named variable for later use.
- value list: Shows all saved region variables.
- value delete: Removes a saved region by name.
- value <varName> [chamberName]: Generates a chamber from the saved region. If chamberName is omitted, <varName> is used as the chamber name. If no saved var exists and the sender is a player with a WorldEdit selection, falls back to using the selection.
- coords: Generates a chamber from two corners specified as either `<x1,y1,z1> <x2,y2,z2>` or legacy `<x1,y1,z1-x2,y2,z2>`. From console, you must also provide `[world]`.
- wand: Generates a chamber from your current WorldEdit selection. Handy shortcut for admins.
- blocks: Generates a chamber at your current location and facing, sized to approximately `<amount>` blocks. The plugin enforces a minimum of 31x15x31 and will round up by at most `generation.blocks.rounding-allowance` (default 1000) to form a clean region.

Notes:
- Minimum size enforced: 31x15x31 (width x height x depth)
- Maximum volume limited by `generation.max-volume` in config.yml
- WorldEdit must be installed for the `value` operations
- Mirrors auto-scan and auto-snapshot behavior from `/tcp add`

---

Registers an existing Trial Chamber from your WorldEdit selection for management by the plugin.

**Usage:**
```
/tcp add <chamber_name>
```

**Permission:** `tcp.admin.create`

**Requirements:**
- Must be a player (not console)
- WorldEdit must be installed
- Must have an active WorldEdit selection

**Arguments:**
- `<chamber_name>` - Name for your chamber (no spaces!)

**Examples:**
```
/tcp add MainChamber
/tcp add NetherChamber1
/tcp add SpawnTC
```

**What it does:**
1. Registers the selected region as a managed chamber
2. Auto-scans for vaults/spawners (if `auto-scan-on-register: true`)
3. Auto-creates snapshot (if `auto-snapshot-on-register: true`)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** This command registers **existing** Trial Chambers. Use WorldEdit to select the entire chamber structure, then run this command to add it to the plugin's management system.
{% endhint %}

**Related:** See [Your First Chamber](../getting-started/your-first-chamber.md) guide

---

### `/tcp scan <chamber>`

Scans a chamber to detect vaults, trial spawners, and decorated pots.

**Usage:**
```
/tcp scan <chamber_name>
```

**Permission:** `tcp.admin.scan`

**Arguments:**
- `<chamber_name>` - Name of the chamber to scan

**Examples:**
```
/tcp scan MainChamber
/tcp scan NetherChamber1
```

**What it finds:**
- **Vaults** (normal and ominous)
- **Trial Spawners** (normal and ominous)
- **Decorated Pots**

**Output example:**
```
[TCP] Scanning chamber MainChamber...
[TCP] Scanning complete! Found 8 vaults, 12 spawners, 24 decorated pots.
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Re-scanning overwrites previous data!** If you modified your chamber and re-scan, old vault/spawner data is replaced.
{% endhint %}

---

### `/tcp setexit <chamber>`

Sets the exit location for a chamber. Players inside when the chamber resets will teleport here.

**Usage:**
```
/tcp setexit <chamber_name>
```

**Permission:** `tcp.admin.create`

**Requirements:**
- Must be a player (not console)

**Arguments:**
- `<chamber_name>` - Name of the chamber

**Examples:**
```
/tcp setexit MainChamber
```

Stand where you want players to teleport (usually just outside the entrance), then run the command. Your exact position and look direction are saved.

**Tips:**
- Set the exit OUTSIDE the chamber boundaries
- Face the direction you want players to look when teleported
- Test it with `/tcp reset <chamber>` to see where players go

---

### `/tcp snapshot <action> <chamber>`

Manage chamber snapshots (saved states for resets).

**Usage:**
```
/tcp snapshot create <chamber_name>
/tcp snapshot restore <chamber_name>
```

**Permission:** `tcp.admin.snapshot`

**Actions:**

#### `create` - Create Snapshot
Scans the chamber and saves every block to a compressed snapshot file.

**Example:**
```
/tcp snapshot create MainChamber
```

**What happens:**
1. Scans all blocks in chamber boundaries
2. Saves block types, orientations, tile entity data
3. Compresses and stores in `snapshots/<chamber>.dat`

**Time:** 5-30 seconds depending on chamber size

{% hint style="success" %}
**Update snapshots anytime!** Made changes to your chamber? Run `/tcp snapshot create` again to update.
{% endhint %}

#### `restore` - Restore Snapshot
Immediately resets the chamber from its snapshot (same as `/tcp reset`).

**Example:**
```
/tcp snapshot restore MainChamber
```

Useful for testing or forcing manual resets.

---

### `/tcp reset <chamber>`

Forces an immediate chamber reset.

**Usage:**
```
/tcp reset <chamber_name>
```

**Permission:** `tcp.admin.reset`

**Arguments:**
- `<chamber_name>` - Name of the chamber to reset

**Examples:**
```
/tcp reset MainChamber

```

**What it does:**
1. Teleports all players inside to the exit location
2. Restores all blocks from snapshot
3. Resets vault states
4. Removes spawned mobs (configurable)
5. Clears ground items (configurable)

**Use cases:**
- Testing chamber functionality
- Manual reset for events
- Fixing a broken chamber

{% hint style="info" %}

## üí° Pro Tips

{% hint style="success" %}
**Use tab completion!** Press `Tab` while typing commands to autocomplete chamber names, player names, and arguments.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Aliases:** All leaderboard commands work with `/tcp lb` and `/tcp top` for quick access.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Chamber names are case-sensitive** in some commands. Use tab completion to ensure correct capitalization.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Offline player support:** Most commands work with offline players (like `/tcp vault reset`), but `/tcp key give` requires the player to be online.
{% endhint %}

## üîß Command Permissions

For a complete list of all permissions (including per-command permissions), see the [Permissions](permissions.md) page.

**Quick permission groups:**

**Full Admin:**
```yaml
tcp.admin
tcp.admin.*
```

**Statistics Access:**
```yaml
tcp.stats
tcp.admin.stats
```

**Read-only Access:**

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

**"Unknown subcommand"**
- Check spelling (use tab completion!)
- Verify you have permission for that command
- Run `/tcp help` to see available commands

**"You don't have permission to use this command"**
- Check with your server admin for permissions
- See [Permissions](permissions.md) for the full list

**"Chamber not found"**
- Use `/tcp list` to see all chambers
- Chamber names are case-sensitive
- Use tab completion to avoid typos

**"No WorldEdit selection found"**
- Make sure WorldEdit is installed
- Use `/wand` and select two corners
- Your selection must have volume (not flat)

**"Player not found or not online"**
- Player must be online for `/tcp key give` and `/tcp key check`
- For offline players, use `/tcp vault reset` (works offline)

**"Snapshot operation failed"**
- Check console for detailed error
- Ensure disk space is available
- Verify file permissions on `plugins/TrialChamberPro/snapshots/` folder
