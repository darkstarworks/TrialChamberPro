#
# ============================================
# MULTI-POOL LOOT SYSTEM (NEW!)
# ============================================
# Like vanilla, you can create multiple loot pools that each roll independently.
# This is OPTIONAL - the single-pool format above still works!
#
# Example: Vanilla-like loot with common/rare/unique pools
#
#  vanilla-style:
#    pools:
#      # Common pool - always gives 2-3 basic items
#      - name: common
#        min-rolls: 2
#        max-rolls: 3
#        weighted-items:
#          - type: IRON_INGOT
#            amount-min: 3
#            amount-max: 7
#            weight: 30.0
#          - type: GOLD_INGOT
#            amount-min: 2
#            amount-max: 5
#            weight: 25.0
#          - type: ARROW
#            amount-min: 16
#            amount-max: 32
#            weight: 20.0
#          - type: BREAD
#            amount-min: 5
#            amount-max: 10
#            weight: 25.0
#
#      # Rare pool - gives 1-2 valuable items
#      - name: rare
#        min-rolls: 1
#        max-rolls: 2
#        weighted-items:
#          - type: DIAMOND
#            amount-min: 1
#            amount-max: 3
#            weight: 15.0
#          - type: EMERALD
#            amount-min: 3
#            amount-max: 8
#            weight: 20.0
#          - type: GOLDEN_APPLE
#            amount-min: 1
#            amount-max: 1
#            weight: 12.0
#          - type: ENCHANTED_BOOK
#            amount-min: 1
#            amount-max: 1
#            weight: 8.0
#            enchantments:
#              - "SHARPNESS:3"
#
#      # Unique pool - rare chance at 0-1 special item
#      - name: unique
#        min-rolls: 0
#        max-rolls: 1
#        weighted-items:
#          - type: ENCHANTED_GOLDEN_APPLE
#            amount-min: 1
#            amount-max: 1
#            weight: 3.0
#            name: "&6&lRare Treasure"
#          - type: NETHERITE_INGOT
#            amount-min: 1
#            amount-max: 1
#            weight: 2.0
#          - type: ELYTRA
#            amount-min: 1
#            amount-max: 1
#            weight: 1.0
#            name: "&5&lUltra Rare!"
#
# Benefits of multi-pool system:
# - Each pool rolls independently (more predictable loot)
# - Better control over loot distribution (common vs rare vs unique)
# - Matches vanilla Trial Chamber behavior
# - Can have 0-roll pools for bonus/rare items
#
# Note: GUI loot editor supports both legacy and multi-pool formats!
