CRITICAL FIXES:
  • Fixed vault opening crash (Dispatchers.Main error)
  • Fixed vault statistics never being recorded
  • Fixed database connection exhaustion causing 60s timeouts
  • Fixed vault spam-clicking exploit allowing duplicate opens
BREAKING CHANGE:
  • Default vault cooldown changed from 24/48h to -1 (permanent lock)
  • This matches vanilla Minecraft behavior - vaults lock until chamber reset
  • Set custom cooldowns in config.yml if you want time-based unlocking
NEW FEATURES:
  • Added locked vault counts to /tcp menu chamber tooltips
  • Added permanent lock message (distinct from cooldown messages)
  • Added spam-click protection with 5-second in-memory lock
MIGRATION:
  • Existing opened vaults will now be permanently locked
  • Use /tcp reset <chamber> to unlock all vaults in a chamber
  • Update config.yml if you prefer time-based cooldowns
