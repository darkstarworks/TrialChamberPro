> _Transform your Trial Chambers from dusty, one-time dungeons into renewable content!_

The best part is, it's not even limited to Trial Chambers üòâ You could designate any area to be automatically reset with griefing protection and include custom per-player loot, or not if you want. 
Works very well for Minigames, like a maze or parkour also. The limit is your imagination.

### Now with a GUI!

- **Automatic resets** `//` **Per-player loot** `//` **Custom rewards**
- **Griefing Protection** `//` **Statistics & Leaderboard** `//` **Ominous support**
- **Key management** `//` **Placing Trial Chamber from included Schematic**

## üéì Fun Fact

Did you know Trial Chambers were originally designed as single-player content? The devs didn't account for multiplayer servers where hundreds of players might visit the same chamber. That's why vault loot is "first come, first served" in vanilla.

We fixed that. You're welcome. üòé
